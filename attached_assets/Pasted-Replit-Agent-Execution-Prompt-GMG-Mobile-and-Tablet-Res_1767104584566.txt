Replit Agent Execution Prompt - GMG Mobile and Tablet Responsiveness Finalisation (iPhone, Android, iPad)

Objective
Make the Greene Mechanical Group site production-grade across all key breakpoints:

* iPhone (360–430px)
* Android (360–480px)
* Large phones (480–640px)
* iPad / tablets (768–1024px, portrait + landscape)
* Desktop (1024px+)
  This is a responsive QA and hardening pass, not a redesign.

Rules

* Preserve existing design language (dark + gold).
* No new sections. No layout rework beyond responsive adjustments.
* Do not introduce horizontal scrolling at any breakpoint.
* Ensure touch targets, spacing, and readability meet modern standards.

Step 1 - Add explicit responsive breakpoints and global guardrails

1. Confirm viewport meta tag exists in index.html:

* <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1" />

2. Add global CSS guardrails (main.css or equivalent):

* Ensure all media elements are constrained:
  img, video, canvas, svg { max-width: 100%; height: auto; }
* Prevent overflow:
  html, body { overflow-x: hidden; }
* Ensure all sections respect viewport width:
  .container (or equivalent wrapper) uses:
  width: 100%;
  max-width: [existing max];
  padding-left/right that scales per breakpoint.

Step 2 - Fix header and navigation on mobile
Goal: On mobile, header must be compact, usable, and not crowded.

Actions:

* Confirm there is a mobile menu/hamburger. If absent or inadequate:

  * Implement a simple hamburger toggle for nav links.
  * When open, show links in a vertical stack with clear spacing.
  * Lock background scroll when menu is open.
  * Close menu on link click and on Escape.
* Ensure header elements do not wrap awkwardly:

  * Logo left
  * Hamburger right
  * If Call Now button must exist on mobile, either:

    * Place it inside the mobile menu as the first CTA, or
    * Keep it in header but reduce height and padding.
* Touch targets:

  * All tappable elements minimum 44px height.

Acceptance:

* At 375px width (iPhone), no wrapping mess, no clipped buttons, no overlap.
* Nav is fully reachable and readable.

Step 3 - Hero section responsiveness
Actions:

* Ensure hero text scales cleanly:

  * Use clamp() for headline and subhead sizes.
  * Reduce line-length on mobile.
* Ensure hero CTAs stack on mobile:

  * Buttons full width (or 2-up if there is room), with proper spacing.
* Ensure any hero background image/video is:

  * Centered
  * Not cropped awkwardly
  * Not causing layout shift

Acceptance:

* On iPhone, hero headline readable, buttons tappable, no text overflow.

Step 4 - Services and Sectors card grid responsiveness
Actions:

* Convert card layouts to responsive grid rules:

  * Mobile: 1 column
  * Tablet portrait: 2 columns
  * Tablet landscape / small desktop: 3 columns (if it fits without squashing)
* Standardise:

  * Card padding
  * Card height behavior (avoid uneven spacing)
  * Title and body typography scaling with clamp()

Acceptance:

* Cards are not cramped on mobile and do not appear “tiny” on iPad.

Step 5 - Contact section (form + contact info) on mobile/tablet
Actions:

* Ensure the contact section collapses into a single column on small screens:

  * Contact info above form, or form above contact info (choose what reads best).
* Ensure the custom service dropdown works on touch:

  * Tap opens reliably
  * Scroll inside menu works without locking the whole page
  * Menu doesn’t render off-screen (add positioning logic if needed).
* Inputs:

  * Full width on mobile
  * Adequate vertical spacing
  * Font size >= 16px to prevent iOS zoom-on-focus

Acceptance:

* On iPhone: no off-screen fields, no tiny dropdown, no unreadable option list.
* On iPad: two-column layout may return if it remains comfortable (>= 900px width).

Step 6 - Footer responsiveness
Actions:

* Convert footer to stacked layout on mobile:

  * Logo and description
  * Contact links
  * Quick links
* Ensure spacing and alignment is clean, with no compressed columns.

Acceptance:

* Footer reads naturally on mobile without dense multi-column squeezing.

Step 7 - Device QA checklist and hard fixes
You must test using DevTools responsive mode for these exact widths:

* 360 x 800 (Android small)
* 375 x 812 (iPhone)
* 390 x 844 (iPhone 12/13/14)
* 430 x 932 (iPhone Max)
* 768 x 1024 (iPad portrait)
* 1024 x 768 (iPad landscape)

Fix the following if present:

* Any horizontal scroll: identify the offending element and constrain it.
* Any clipped dropdown/menu: adjust positioning and max-height.
* Any text overflow: apply wrap rules and clamp sizing.
* Any tap targets too small: increase padding/height.
* Any excessive vertical whitespace on mobile: tighten section padding at <= 480px.

Deliverables

* Implement responsive CSS adjustments and any small JS tweaks required (mobile menu behavior, dropdown positioning).
* Confirm no breakpoint has horizontal scroll.
* Confirm contact form remains Netlify-ready and functional.
* Provide a short summary of what was changed (files touched, key responsive improvements).

Proceed to implement now in the codebase.
