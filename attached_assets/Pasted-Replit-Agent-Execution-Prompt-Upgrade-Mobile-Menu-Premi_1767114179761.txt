Replit Agent Execution Prompt - Upgrade Mobile Menu (Premium Drawer, Bigger Logo, Better Proportions)

Objective
The new mobile drawer is directionally correct, but it still feels basic. Improve the mobile menu so it looks more premium:

* The drawer should not feel like it stretches unnecessarily the full height with dead space.
* Make the GMG logo noticeably bigger and more brand-forward.
* Improve spacing, hierarchy, and finish so it feels “high-end”, not “default”.

Constraints

* Keep the same slide-in drawer architecture and current open/close logic.
* Do not reintroduce scroll blocking when menu is closed.
* Keep theme consistent (dark + gold).
* Maintain accessibility (keyboard, focus trap, ESC close).

Part 1 - Make the drawer feel more designed (not a blank full-height panel)

1. Reduce the “empty wall” feel
   Implement one of these approaches (choose the one that fits the current code cleanly):

Option A (recommended): Full-height drawer, but with structured sections

* Keep height: 100dvh (required for safe behavior), BUT visually segment it:

  * Top brand header (logo + close)
  * Nav section (links)
  * CTA section (pinned bottom)
* Add subtle internal dividers:

  * Thin 1px line in low-opacity gold/white between header and nav
  * Another divider above CTA block
* Add a subtle background texture:

  * Very subtle radial gradient, not blur, no heavy filters
  * Avoid “boxy flat rectangle” feeling

Option B: Drawer with “carded” nav container inside

* Keep drawer full-height, but place the nav list inside a centered panel with rounded corners:

  * Panel background slightly lighter than drawer
  * Panel padding 16–20px
  * Panel max-width ~360px
    This makes it feel intentional without breaking usability.

Do NOT make the drawer actually shorter than the viewport, because that causes awkward tap/scroll edge cases. The visual treatment should make it feel tighter while remaining technically full-height.

2. Improve the nav typography and rhythm

* Increase link font-size slightly (eg 18–20px)
* Reduce excessive vertical spacing if present
* Add a micro-interaction:

  * On tap/active: subtle gold left bar or underline
  * On hover (desktop emulation): subtle highlight, no neon

Part 2 - Make the GMG logo significantly bigger
Requirement

* The GMG logo in the mobile drawer header is currently too small.
* Increase it materially so it feels like a brand moment.

Implementation details

* Increase logo height to ~28–34px (depending on available space)
* Ensure it remains sharp:

  * If SVG: scale normally
  * If PNG: use correct sizing and avoid CSS blur
* Keep it vertically aligned with the close button
* Add a small label under it only if it already exists elsewhere (otherwise keep logo-only)

Part 3 - Improve close button and top bar polish

* Make close button a proper icon button:

  * 40–44px hit area
  * Slight background on tap/hover (subtle)
  * Gold or off-white icon for visibility
* Add safe-area top padding (already done) but ensure the header doesn’t sit too low.

Part 4 - CTA section refinement (reduce “two giant bars” look)
Current issue on the iPhone screenshot: the two CTAs feel like big slabs.
Improve:

* Keep “Call Now” as the primary CTA.
* If “Request a Quote” exists in the menu, make it secondary and lighter:

  * Outlined, slimmer height, less dominant.
* Reduce CTA height slightly on mobile:

  * Target 48–52px height
* Improve spacing:

  * 10–12px gap between CTAs
  * 16–20px padding around CTA block

Part 5 - Menu must remain fluid and never block page scroll when closed
Regression guardrails

* Confirm body scroll lock only applies when menu is open.
* Confirm decorative layers still have pointer-events: none.
* Confirm no expensive mobile blur was reintroduced.

Acceptance criteria (must pass)

* On iPhone width (390px):

  * Drawer feels designed and premium (structured sections, not a blank wall)
  * GMG logo is clearly visible and brand-forward (noticeably bigger)
  * CTAs feel refined (not giant slabs)
  * Menu opens/closes smoothly; no scroll blocking when closed
* On Android width (360px):

  * No overflow, no clipped content
* Accessibility remains:

  * ESC closes
  * Focus trap works
  * Close returns focus to hamburger

Deliverable
Implement these refinements directly in the codebase (header/menu CSS and markup only), restart preview, and validate on mobile viewport emulation.
