Replit Agent Execution Prompt - Header Nav Centering + Remove “Request a Quote” + Reposition “Call Now”

Objective
Tighten the top navbar:

* Center-align the navigation links (Services, Sectors, About, Contact) as a group.
* Remove the header “Request a Quote” button completely.
* Move the “Call Now” button into the “Request a Quote” button’s former position (far top-right), so there is only ONE header CTA.

Constraints

* No redesign, no new sections.
* Preserve existing brand (dark + gold).
* Do not break mobile layout or hamburger menu behavior.

Tasks

1. Center the main nav links

* Locate the header/nav component (search for header markup containing “Services”, “Sectors”, “About”, “Contact”).
* Adjust the header layout so the nav links group is visually centered across the available width.
  Implementation requirements:
* The nav links should sit in the middle of the header (balanced left-right).
* Use consistent spacing between links.
* Ensure hover underline/fade behavior remains unchanged.
* Do not allow link wrapping on desktop; if needed tighten spacing slightly.

Target layout:
[Logo (left)]  [Services  Sectors  About  Contact (centered)]  [Call Now CTA (right)]

2. Remove the header “Request a Quote” button

* Delete/hide the “Request a Quote” button in the top navbar.
* Do not remove the hero section “Request a Quote” button (keep the homepage CTA pair).

3. Move “Call Now” into the removed button’s position

* Ensure the “Call Now” CTA occupies the far top-right slot where “Request a Quote” previously was.
* There must only be one CTA in the header.
* Confirm the “Call Now” CTA remains gold background with black text (as previously specified), with a subtle hover effect.

4. Maintain responsive behavior

* Desktop: nav centered, no overlap, no clipping.
* Tablet: nav remains usable; if space is tight, reduce nav gap slightly.
* Mobile: keep hamburger menu behavior unchanged:

  * If a mobile menu exists, “Call Now” appears either:

    * as the top item in the menu, or
    * stays in the header if there is room
  * Ensure no double CTA appears.

Acceptance Checks

* On desktop (≥1024px): nav links visually centered; only one header CTA visible (Call Now on far right).
* On iPad widths (768–1024px): no wrapping or overlap.
* On mobile (≤480px): header remains clean; menu operates normally; no duplicate CTAs.

Deliverable
Implement changes in the codebase, run preview, and confirm the header matches the target layout and remains responsive.
