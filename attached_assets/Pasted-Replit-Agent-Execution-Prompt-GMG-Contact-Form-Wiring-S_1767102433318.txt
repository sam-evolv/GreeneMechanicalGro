Replit Agent Execution Prompt - GMG Contact Form Wiring + Service Dropdown Fix

Objective
Wire the “Get in Touch” form so it reliably delivers submissions to [dgmechanicalgroup@gmail.com](mailto:dgmechanicalgroup@gmail.com) via Netlify Forms, and replace the native “Select a service” dropdown with a theme-consistent, high-clarity custom dropdown that matches the site (dark + gold).

Non-negotiables

* Do not redesign the site.
* Keep the existing layout and spacing as-is.
* Improve clarity, contrast, and interaction quality.
* Make form submission production-reliable on Netlify.
* Ensure the selected service value is actually included in the form submission payload.

Part A - Proper Netlify Forms wiring (so Send Message goes to email)

1. Locate the contact form

* Search the codebase for “Send Message”, “Get in Touch”, or the contact form component.
* Identify the <form> element and its inputs.

2. Convert the form to Netlify Forms-compatible markup
   Apply these exact requirements:

* The form must include:

  * method="POST"
  * data-netlify="true"
  * name="gmg-contact"
  * data-netlify-honeypot="bot-field"
* Add hidden input for Netlify form name:

  * <input type="hidden" name="form-name" value="gmg-contact" />
* Add honeypot field (hidden from users):

  * <p className="hidden">
      <label>
        Don’t fill this out if you’re human: <input name="bot-field" />
      </label>
    </p>
* Ensure all user fields have proper name attributes (critical for Netlify):

  * name="name"
  * name="phone"
  * name="email"
  * name="service"
  * name="message"

3. Add a reliable submit handler UX (but keep Netlify POST)

* Do NOT prevent default submission unless you re-post the form yourself.
* Preferred approach:

  * Let the form submit normally (Netlify handles it).
  * Add a success “thank you” view using Netlify redirect:

    * Option 1: action="/thank-you"
    * Create a simple /thank-you route/page, or if this is a static single-page site, add a small thank-you state page section that can render at /thank-you.
* If the app is SPA without routing, use encode + fetch approach instead (acceptable fallback):

  * Prevent default
  * POST as application/x-www-form-urlencoded to "/"
  * Show inline success message
  * This must preserve Netlify form detection:

    * The real <form> still needs data-netlify="true" and hidden form-name input.

4. Verify Netlify detection

* Ensure there is no conditional rendering that removes the form from the built HTML.
* If needed, add a hidden static form stub somewhere in the page (Netlify detection trick):

  * <form name="gmg-contact" data-netlify="true" data-netlify-honeypot="bot-field" hidden>
      <input type="text" name="name" />
      <input type="text" name="phone" />
      <input type="email" name="email" />
      <input type="text" name="service" />
      <textarea name="message"></textarea>
    </form>

Only do this if the main form is dynamically injected and Netlify doesn’t detect it.

Expected result

* When deployed to Netlify, submissions appear in Netlify Forms.
* Email notifications (already configured) send to [dgmechanicalgroup@gmail.com](mailto:dgmechanicalgroup@gmail.com).

Part B - Replace “Select a service” <select> with a themed, clear dropdown
Problem
The current dropdown uses native browser rendering and the options list has poor readability and inconsistent theme.

Requirement
Replace the native <select> with a custom, accessible dropdown component that matches the site theme.

Implementation Approach (recommended)

* Use @headlessui/react Listbox (accessible, keyboard nav, themeable).
* Install if not present:

  * npm i @headlessui/react
    (Only install if missing; check package.json first.)

Dropdown UI specification (must match dark + gold)
Trigger button

* Background: same as input fields (dark slate/charcoal used in the form)
* Border: 1px solid gold accent
* Text: light grey/white
* Placeholder: “Select a service” visible and not low-contrast
* Right-side icon: small chevron (can be inline SVG)

Menu panel

* Background: dark charcoal (slightly lighter than page background)
* Border: 1px solid gold
* Shadow: subtle (soft, not bright)
* Rounded corners consistent with other inputs
* Max height with scroll (no massive overlay)

Option rows

* Default: light text, clear spacing
* Hover/active: gold background with black text (high clarity)
* Selected state: show checkmark + bold text or gold accent
* Transition: subtle fade/slide (200ms)

Data binding (critical)

* The selected service must be included in the form submission as name="service"
* Implement this by adding a hidden input:

  * <input type="hidden" name="service" value={selectedService} />
* Keep the service list the same options as before (do not rewrite the business offering)

Integration steps

1. Identify current services list used in the select.
2. Replace select with Listbox using that same array of services.
3. Bind selected option to state (selectedService).
4. Add hidden input so Netlify receives it.
5. Ensure keyboard works:

   * Tab focus to trigger
   * Enter opens
   * Arrow keys navigate
   * Enter selects
   * Esc closes

Part C - Testing steps you must run

1. Local sanity check

* Run dev server.
* Fill all fields.
* Choose a service.
* Confirm the hidden “service” input value updates when selection changes.

2. Netlify test (post-deploy)

* Deploy.
* Submit the form.
* Confirm:

  * Netlify dashboard shows the submission under Forms.
  * Email arrives at [dgmechanicalgroup@gmail.com](mailto:dgmechanicalgroup@gmail.com).
  * Service field is present in the submission payload.

Deliverables

* Updated contact form wired for Netlify Forms (gmg-contact).
* Replaced service dropdown with themed custom dropdown.
* Clear visual readability and consistent dark + gold styling.
* No layout regressions on mobile.

Do the work now, implement directly in the codebase, and verify the form submission payload includes the selected service.
