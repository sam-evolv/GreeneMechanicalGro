Replit Agent - Stop all mobile scroll blocking on initial load (make scroll available instantly)

Goal
Mobile must scroll instantly on first touch after load. Zero seconds delay. No exceptions. This must hold on iPhone Safari and Android Chrome.

Non-negotiable rules
- Menu closed: scrolling must never be locked.
- Menu open: you may lock scroll.
- No decorative layer is allowed to capture touch or pan gestures at any time.
- Remove any “intro gating” that delays interaction until animations finish.

Part A - Identify the actual blocker (do not skip)
1) Add a temporary touch probe in src/main.ts (or the app entry) to print what element is under the finger during the “cannot scroll” window.

Add this near startup (temporary):
- On first touchstart, run elementFromPoint(x,y)
- Log: tagName, id, className
- Log computed styles: position, zIndex, pointerEvents, touchAction, overflow
- Also log: body overflow, html overflow, body position
- Log at t=0ms, 250ms, 1000ms, 2500ms after DOMContentLoaded.

This tells us whether it is:
A) overlay capturing touch
B) scroll lock on body/html
C) main thread freeze

Part B - Fix path 1: overlay capturing touch (most common)
If elementFromPoint returns a hero overlay, fx layer, backdrop, or pseudo layer:
1) Apply a hard global rule for all decorative layers:
- pointer-events: none !important;
- touch-action: auto !important;

2) Also disable pointer events on pseudo elements:
- .fx-layer::before, .fx-layer::after { pointer-events: none !important; }

3) Ensure these layers are not above content:
- lower z-index below header/content
- do not place them inside a fixed full-screen wrapper that sits above everything

Part C - Fix path 2: scroll lock during init (second most common)
If logs show overflow hidden or body is fixed for a few seconds:
1) Remove every scroll-lock call from startup code.
2) Create exactly one scroll lock implementation and only use it for the mobile menu.

Implement a single source of truth:
- When menu opens: document.body.classList.add("menu-open")
- When menu closes: document.body.classList.remove("menu-open")
No other code is allowed to touch body/html overflow or position.

CSS:
body.menu-open { overflow: hidden; }

Also, delete any “ensureScrollEnabled after load” hacks. They are masking the real issue.

Part D - Fix path 3: main thread freeze (scroll feels dead, no overlay found)
If elementFromPoint returns normal content but scroll still does nothing, you are blocking the UI thread on load.

Actions:
1) Find any heavy startup work:
- large DOM queries and repeated layout reads
- animation initialisers
- intersection observer loops
- blur/backdrop-filter heavy layers
- any requestAnimationFrame loops starting immediately

2) Defer heavy work until after first interaction or idle time:
- Use requestIdleCallback (fallback setTimeout 1000) to initialise heavy effects
- On mobile, disable expensive effects entirely

Mobile gating:
@media (max-width: 768px) {
  * { scroll-behavior: auto; }
  .heavy-blur, .backdrop, .parallax, .cinematic-filter { display: none !important; }
  .reveal, .fade-in, .slide-up { opacity: 1 !important; transform: none !important; transition: none !important; }
}

Part E - Remove a common killer: full-height wrappers that block scroll
Audit CSS for any container using:
- height: 100vh
- position: fixed
- overflow: hidden
applied to wrappers like #root, main, hero container, page container.

On mobile, replace height: 100vh with:
min-height: 100svh;
height: auto;

And ensure the scrolling container is the document:
html, body { height: auto; overflow-y: auto; }

Part F - Verification (must pass)
1) iPhone Safari real device:
- hard refresh
- immediately swipe up: page must move instantly
2) Android Chrome:
- same
3) Open menu:
- page behind does not scroll
4) Close menu:
- scroll instantly restored

Deliverables
- Remove the probe logs after confirming the culprit and fix.
- Summarise root cause in a short comment in VERIFICATION.md:
  "Mobile scroll delay was caused by X; fixed by Y; verified on iPhone Safari and Android Chrome."
Implement now. Do not guess. Use the probe to identify the blocker and eliminate it.
