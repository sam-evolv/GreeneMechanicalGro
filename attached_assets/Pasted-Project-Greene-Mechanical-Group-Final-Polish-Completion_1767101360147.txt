Project: Greene Mechanical Group – Final Polish & Completion Pass
Goal: Subtle uplift, tighter layout, smoother UX. No rebrand. No visual overreach.

1. Header & Primary CTA Cleanup

Problem: “Call Dan” button feels oversized, boxy, and visually disconnected.

Actions:

Remove the “Call Dan” button entirely.

Replace with a compact, text-based primary CTA:

Label: “Call Now”

Style:

Inline button or pill

Height reduced by ~30–40%

Border-radius: 999px (pill)

Subtle gold outline or underline on hover

No solid block fill by default

Add a secondary CTA beside it:

“Request a Quote”

Slightly stronger weight than “Call Now” but still restrained

Ensure both CTAs align vertically with the navigation text baseline (no floating or oversized alignment).

Outcome: Header feels balanced, premium, and intentional.

2. Navigation Alignment Fix

Problem: Services / Sectors / About / Contact feel spread and off-centre.

Actions:

Re-center the main navigation group horizontally.

Use equal spacing between items.

Ensure hover states are consistent:

Subtle gold underline or fade

No jumps, no size changes

Reduce header height slightly to tighten first impression.

Outcome: Navigation reads clean, symmetrical, and calm.

3. Contact Details Integration (From Provided Image)

Details to add globally (footer + contact section):

Phone: 087 702 5171

Email: dgmechanicalgroup@gmail.com

Actions:

Add phone and email text links:

Use icons only if minimal (thin line icons)

Gold accent on hover only

Make phone number clickable (tel:)

Make email clickable (mailto:)

Ensure these details are NOT trapped inside an image anywhere on the site.

Outcome: Contact info is accessible, usable, and professional.

4. CTA Button Refinement (Hero Section)

Problem: “Call Now” and “Request a Quote” feel basic.

Actions:

Redesign both buttons with:

Softer radius

Better padding ratios (more horizontal than vertical)

Subtle hover animation:

Background fade or outline glow

No scale jump

Ensure contrast passes accessibility but avoids harsh brightness.

Align buttons cleanly under hero text with consistent spacing.

Outcome: Buttons feel modern, confident, and finished.

5. Services Section Tightening

Actions:

Slightly reduce vertical spacing between service items.

Improve text rhythm:

Headings slightly bolder

Body text slightly lighter

Add very subtle hover feedback:

Light background lift

Soft gold accent line or shadow

No cards flying, flipping, or dramatic animations.

Outcome: Services feel refined and easy to scan.

6. Visual Consistency Pass

Apply globally:

Reduce excessive gold usage; keep it as an accent, not a fill.

Ensure:

Same border-radius language everywhere

Same hover timing (≈200–250ms)

Same font weights for similar roles

Smooth scrolling enabled if not already.

Outcome: Site feels cohesive and deliberate.

7. Performance & Finish

Remove any unused styles or scripts related to old buttons.

Ensure mobile:

Header does not feel crowded

CTAs stack cleanly

No layout shift on load.
