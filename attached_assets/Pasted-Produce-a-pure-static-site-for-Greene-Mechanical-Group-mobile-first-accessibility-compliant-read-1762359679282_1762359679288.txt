Produce a pure static site for Greene Mechanical Group (mobile-first, accessibility-compliant), ready for Netlify drag-and-drop (no build step) and Replit “Static HTML/CSS/JS.” Output a single artifact: greene-mechanical-group-netlify-static.zip.

Pre-flight (stop build auto-detection)

If any of these files exist at repo root, delete them to avoid Replit/Netlify build detection:

package.json, pnpm-lock.yaml, yarn.lock, package-lock.json, vite.config.*, next.config.*, astro.config.*, svelte.config.*, webpack.config.*, .parcelrc, .nvmrc

/src frameworks scaffolds; /functions or /netlify/functions (unless intentionally used)

Ensure index.html is at project root and there is no build or dist step.

Deliverables (create these exactly):

index.html
css/main.css
js/main.js
assets/img/logo.svg
assets/img/hero.webp
assets/img/hero.jpg
assets/img/p1.jpg
assets/img/p2.jpg
assets/img/p3.jpg
assets/icons/favicon.ico
assets/icons/icon-192.png
assets/icons/icon-512.png
assets/icons/apple-touch-icon.png
site.webmanifest
robots.txt
sitemap.xml
netlify.toml
README.md


Implementation requirements

Mobile: no horizontal scroll at 360px; grids collapse to 1 column on narrow screens.

Perf: hero uses <picture> with WebP + JPG fallback; non-hero images loading="lazy" and decoding="async".

A11y: keyboard-navigable hamburger (aria-expanded, [hidden]), visible focus, <label>s for inputs.

Contact form wired for Netlify Forms (data-netlify="true", hidden form-name).

netlify.toml:

[build] command = "" and publish = "."

Security headers (X-Content-Type-Options, X-Frame-Options=SAMEORIGIN, Referrer-Policy, Permissions-Policy)

Cache: [[headers]] for = "/assets/*" → Cache-Control: public, max-age=31536000, immutable

README.md: step-by-step deploy instructions for Netlify (no build) and Replit Static.

Packaging

Zip exactly the files above into greene-mechanical-group-netlify-static.zip at repo root (no nested folder levels).

Post-flight validation (agent must verify)

Open index.html preview at 360, 768, 1024, 1440 — confirm nav toggles and no x-scroll.

Confirm there is no package.json or lockfiles at root.

Print the absolute path to the ZIP.

Final message to return

ZIP created and ready for Netlify drag-and-drop (no build):
<absolute-path>/greene-mechanical-group-netlify-static.zip
