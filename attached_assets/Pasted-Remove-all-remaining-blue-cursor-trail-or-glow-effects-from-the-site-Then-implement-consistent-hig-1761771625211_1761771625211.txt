Remove all remaining blue cursor-trail or glow effects from the site. Then implement consistent, high-quality hover effects for all interactive content boxes:

Services cards

Sectors Served cards

How We Work cards

Maintain cinematic polish and the gold/blue brand palette but keep the hover behaviour subtle, responsive, and professional.

⚙️ Implementation Steps
1. Remove Blue Cursor Glow

Delete or disable any JavaScript or CSS referencing cursor or spotlight tracking (look for selectors like body::before, .cursor-glow, or JS events tied to mousemove).

Confirm no pseudo-elements remain that use radial-gradient or background: rgba(40,146,229, …) tied to the cursor position.

2. Add Unified Hover Effect (Services, Sectors, How We Work)

Enhance all card elements with:

Soft elevation on hover (translateY(-6px)),

Blue-gold edge glow using gradient border,

Subtle interior light pulse.

.card, .service-card, .sector-card, .work-step {
  background: rgba(255,255,255,0.02);
  border: 1px solid rgba(255,255,255,0.06);
  border-radius: 12px;
  transition: all 0.4s ease;
  position: relative;
  overflow: hidden;
}

.card:hover, .service-card:hover, .sector-card:hover, .work-step:hover {
  transform: translateY(-6px);
  box-shadow: 0 0 25px rgba(40,146,229,0.25), 0 0 10px rgba(212,177,95,0.15);
  border-color: rgba(212,177,95,0.4);
  background: radial-gradient(circle at 50% 30%, rgba(40,146,229,0.08), rgba(255,255,255,0.01) 70%);
}


Add a faint animated highlight edge:

.card::after, .service-card::after, .sector-card::after, .work-step::after {
  content: '';
  position: absolute;
  inset: 0;
  background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(40,146,229,0.2), rgba(212,177,95,0.2));
  opacity: 0;
  transition: opacity 0.5s ease;
}
.card:hover::after, .service-card:hover::after, .sector-card:hover::after, .work-step:hover::after {
  opacity: 1;
}

3. Responsive & Performance

Use only transform and opacity for animation (GPU-accelerated).

Include will-change: transform, box-shadow; for smoother motion.

Confirm these effects run at 60 fps on mobile and desktop.

✅ Outcome

Cursor glow fully removed (no trailing or ambient blue light).

All major content boxes (Services, Sectors, How We Work) now have elegant lift-and-glow interactions.

Cohesive, premium motion language consistent with your brand palette and cinematic depth.
